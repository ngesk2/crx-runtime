/**
 * Base Worker
 * 
 * Constitutional Base Worker - Minimal abstraction
 * 
 * Workers are thin.
 * Business logic stays inside Authorities.
 * 
 * All workers must:
 * - Extend BaseWorker
 * - Implement process(job) method
 * - Use Authorities for business logic
 * - Use TransactionBoundary for state changes
 * 
 * Architectural Rules:
 * - Do NOT put business logic inside workers
 * - Do NOT access PostgreSQL directly except through Ports
 * - Do NOT publish events outside TransactionBoundary
 * - Do NOT bypass Outbox
 * - Do NOT create worker-specific schemas
 * 
 * Execution is handled by WorkerExecutor.
 * Metrics are handled by WorkerPool or MetricsAuthority.
 * Health is handled by HealthAuthority.
 * Witnesses are handled by WitnessAuthority.
